# Government shutdown fallout, price floors, and AI slop against the machine

> **Summary:** This NPR Indicator podcast covers three major economic stories: the partisan impact of federal infrastructure funding freezes during government shutdown (with Democratic districts losing 37x more funding than Republican ones), Treasury Secretary Scott Besant's proposal for price floors to counter Chinese competition in rare earths, and the flood of AI-generated music on streaming platforms. The episode highlights how political decisions are reshaping infrastructure investment, trade policy, and the creative economy.

## Key topics
- Federal infrastructure funding freeze and partisan distribution
- Price floors and trade war escalation with China
- AI-generated music flooding streaming platforms
- Rare earth elements supply chain and Chinese market dominance
- Impact of AI on musician revenue and creative industries

## Companies
- **Spotify** — Removed approximately 75 million spam tracks from its platform last year due to AI-generated content flood
- **Deezer** — French music streaming service that estimates over 30,000 fully AI-generated tracks are uploaded daily
- **Department of Energy** — Terminated $7.5 billion in grants for 223 energy projects, claiming they weren't economically viable

## Tools
- **AI music generation** — Used to create entire albums like 'Artificial Soul' by Professor Nick Harrison, flooding streaming platforms with synthetic content
