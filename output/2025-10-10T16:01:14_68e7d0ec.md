# The hidden cost of buying gold | Claudia Vega

> **Summary:** Rainforest toxicologist Claudia Vega discusses the devastating environmental and health impacts of mercury pollution from artisanal gold mining in the Amazon. She explains how 20% of global gold production comes from small-scale miners using mercury, releasing 1,400 tons annually into the environment, poisoning indigenous communities through contaminated fish, and destroying vast rainforest areas. Vega established the first mercury testing lab in the Peruvian Amazon to study these effects locally and empower communities with actionable information.

## Key topics

## Noteworthy quotes
> I think people are not aware that sometimes the gold that you buy maybe is poisoning the rainforest in the Amazon or other tropical areas. About 20 percent of the gold produced in the world comes from artisanal gold mining.
— [Claudia Vega's Talk]

> Mercury is called the silent toxin because it takes a while to show effects. Minamata Bay in Japan is the most iconic case of mercury poisoning... It took about 25 years to show the effects in people. About a thousand people died, and until now, they have certified 10,000 people that were affected.

> At the end, we have one health, one planet, and everything is connected. When you're affecting the environment, you can affect the animals' health and then human health too... The forest is producing air. It's producing water. That's more valuable than gold. I know gold is valuable, but you cannot eat it. You cannot breathe it and you cannot drink it.
— [Claudia Vega's Talk]

> We need to have local capacity in the places where the problems are happening, because we need to empower the people in the place because at the end, they are the ones that are suffering the consequences. So I think producing the information, knowing how to produce the information, that also empowers people in the local community and that makes change.
